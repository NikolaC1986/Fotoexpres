The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack photo printing web application called Fotoexpres. The development followed an iterative process, starting with frontend-only mockups based on , then transitioning to a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. Key updates included a complete redesign to match the Photolia theme, localization to Serbian, and the implementation of robust features like an Admin Panel for order management, dynamic pricing, email notifications, and a comprehensive deployment guide. User feedback significantly shaped the product, leading to detailed UI/UX refinements, branding changes, and mobile responsiveness optimizations. Debugging efforts included resolving ZIP file download issues in the admin panel by reordering CORS middleware and adjusting frontend download logic. The work is now focused on further enhancements to the admin panel and upload page.

The goal is to create a modern photo printing website named Fotoexpres with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Users can upload multiple photos, specify format (9x13cm, 10x15cm, 13x18cm, 15x21cm, 20x30cm, 30x45cm), quantity, and paper finish (Glossy/Matte). Dynamic pricing must be calculated. Two mutually exclusive options for photo processing (crop or fill with white) are required per order, included in order details.

The site is localized to Serbian. No customer login or online payment is needed; payment occurs post-delivery. The backend will zip order photos and a  file with customer details.

An Admin Panel is required for order management: viewing, downloading ZIPs, editing prices per format, editing the free delivery limit, and deleting orders. Email notifications for new orders are also needed. A Cenovnik (Prices) page and an FAQ page with specific questions/answers are part of the site structure. Contact information must be consistent and updated across the site. The frontend needs to be responsive across devices, with specific mobile navigation bar adjustments. The homepage formats should lead to the upload page, and a specific hero image and orange color palette for branding are required.

<pending_tasks>
- Add the functionality to delete orders from the admin panel.
- Implement page reload and field reset on the upload page after photos are sent, clearing previously uploaded images.
- Change the text Završetak papira to Tip papira on the upload page.
- Move the admin login button to the bottom of the page.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing several user requests from Chat Message 284. Specifically, the immediate focus is on implementing the ability to delete orders within the admin panel. Concurrently, the engineer is working on refining the upload page's user experience by ensuring that the page reloads and its input fields are reset after an order is submitted, thereby clearing any previously uploaded images. Another task is to update the terminology on the upload page, changing Završetak papira (Paper Finish) to Tip papira (Paper Type). Finally, the admin login button is being repositioned to the bottom of the page to be less visible to general users, enhancing security and improving the overall user interface.
